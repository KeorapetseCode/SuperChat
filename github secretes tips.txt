In order to see your GitHub Secrets follow these steps:

Create a workflow that echos all the secrets to a file.
As the last step of the workflow, start a tmate session.
Enter the GitHub Actions runner via SSH (the SSH address will be displayed in the action log) and view your secrets file.
Here is a complete working GitHub Action to do that:

name: Show Me the S3cr3tz
on: [push]

jobs:
  debug:
    name: Debug
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up secret file
      env:
        DEBUG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DEBUG_PASSWORD }}
        DEBUG_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEBUG_SECRET_KEY }}
      run: |
        echo $DEBUG_PASSWORD >> secrets.txt
        echo $DEBUG_SECRET_KEY >> secrets.txt

    - name: Run tmate
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v2
The reason for using tmate in order to allow SSH access, instead of just running cat secrets.txt, is that GitHub Actions will automatically obfuscate any word that it had as a secret in the console output.
